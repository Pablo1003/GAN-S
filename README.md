# GAN'S
Use of GAN's for different purposes. In the dir MNIST, to different types of GAN's are used to generate digits from the MNIST. The two types are Wasserstein Gan (WGAN) and Deep Convolutional Gans (DCGAN).
In the dir of colorisation we use and autoencoder as the generator of the GAN to colorize images in grey-scale from cifar10 dataset.
